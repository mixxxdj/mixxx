// This interface and base class enable to synchronize external
// track collections with Mixxx. It provides methods that will
// be invoked by Mixxx after tracks have been added, modified or
// deleted in the internal track collection. It also notifies
// external track collections if the metadata of a single track
// has been saved. A track in the internal track collection always
// refers to a single, local file.
//
// All functions must be implemented in a non-blocking fashion,
// i.e. asynchronously. They will be invoked AFTER the corresponding
// operation has been executed on the internal track collection.
//
// WARNING: External track collections MUST NOT modify the track
// files while Mixxx is running to avoid file corruption caused by
// concurrent write access!
