// SoundSource will be used 'soon' and so it should be brought into memory by
// the reader work thread.

    // range (sample, sample+length) should be present in memory.

    // Currently unused -- but in the future could be used to prioritize certain
    // hints over others. A priority of 1 is the highest priority and should be
    // used for samples that will be read imminently. Hints for samples that

// Note that we use a QVarLengthArray here instead of a QVector. Since this list
// is cleared on every callback and potentially referenced multiples times it's
// nicer to use a QVarLengthArray over a QVector because of two things:
//
// 1) No copy-on-write / implicit sharing behavior. If the reference count rises
//    above 1 then every non-const operation on a QVector clones it. We'd like
//    to avoid unnecessary memory allocation in the callback thread so this is
//    undesirable.
// 2) QVector::clear deletes the backing store (even if you call reserve) so we
//    reallocate on every callback. resize(0) should work but a future developer
//    may see a resize(0) and say "that's a silly way of writing clear()!" and
//    replace it without realizing.

// CachingReader provides a layer on top of a SoundSource for reading samples
// from a file. Since we cannot do file I/O in the audio callback thread
// CachingReader and CachingReaderWorker (a worker thread) work in concert to
// read and decode relevant sections of a track in a background thread. The
// decoded chunks are kept in a cache by CachingReader with a
// least-recently-used (LRU) eviction policy. CachingReader exposes a method for
// indicating which chunks should be kept fresh in the cache (see
// hintAndMaybeWake). For example, the chunks around the playhead, the hotcue
// positions, and loop points are all portions of the track that the user is
// likely to dynamically jump to so we should keep them ready.
//
// The least recently used policy is implemented by keeping a linked list of the
// least recently used chunks. When a chunk is "freshened" (i.e. accessed via
// read or hinted via hintAndMaybeWake) then it is moved to the back of the
// least-recently-used list. When a chunk needs to be allocated and there are no
// free chunks then the least recently used chunk is free'd (see
// allocateChunkExpireLRU).
