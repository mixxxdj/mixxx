mixxx_library_struct.tar.gz contains a reference library tree that contains symlinks.
Unpack this somewhere to your mixxx library to check if the library scanner can still handle this. 
The empty.mp3 must not appear more than one time in your library. 
This test works only on file systems that support symlinks.
