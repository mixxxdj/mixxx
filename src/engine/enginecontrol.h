/**
 * EngineControl is an abstract base class for objects which implement
 * functionality pertaining to EngineBuffer. An EngineControl is meant to be a
 * succinct implementation of a given EngineBuffer feature. Previously,
 * EngineBuffer was an example of feature creep -- this is the result.
 *
 * When writing an EngineControl class, the following two properties hold:
 *
 * EngineControl::process will only be called during an EngineBuffer::process
 * callback from the sound engine. This implies that any ControlObject accesses
 * made in either of these methods are mutually exclusive, since one is
 * exclusively in the call graph of the other.
