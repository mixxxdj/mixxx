/// RuntimeLoggingCategory is a wrapper around QLoggingCategory
/// that facilitates using a QLoggingCategory for a category
/// name string that is determined at run time. To use a
/// RuntimeLoggingCategory, simply pass it to the
/// qCInfo, qCDebug, qCWarning, or qCCritical macros like a
/// QLoggingCategory. If the category name is fully known at
/// compile time, simply construct a QLoggingCategory with a
/// string literal instead of using RuntimeLoggingCategory.
///
/// RuntimeLoggingCategory stores the logging category name as a
/// QByteArray. This is helpful because QLoggingCategory has a deleted
/// copy constructor, does not take ownership nor make a copy of the
/// const char* passed to its constructor, and requires that the
/// data pointed to by the const char* lives as long as the
/// QLoggingCategory.
///
/// RuntimeLoggingCategory takes advantage of QByteArray's
/// implicit sharing to ensure that the const char* for the
/// QLoggingCategory lives as long as the QLoggingCategory without
/// requiring excessive deep copies.
