Introduction to Mixxx
*********************

Mixxx allows you to perform live DJ mixes with your digital music collection.
It helps you rock the party with MIDI controllers, vinyl turntables, or even
just your keyboard.

Mixxx is used by professional DJs and bedroom DJs alike. It is designed by an
international team of volunteer DJs who want to bring the joy of DJing to
everyone. The project is non-profit, open-source and community driven. Together
and with your help we aim to build the best DJ software ever created.

Project History
===============

Mixxx was originally created in 2002 as part of a PhD thesis on new interfaces
for DJing by Tue Haste Andersen. After releasing the project as open source,
dozens of contributors began modifying and improving Mixxx.

In 2006, a new development team lead by Adam Davison and Albert Santoni began
reorganizing the project to ensure smooth growth of both the codebase and the
number of contributors. A renewed focus on usability and stability has helped
Mixxx grow to become the most popular free DJ software in the world, receiving
over 1,000,000 downloads annually. Our committed team has worked hard to create
great DJ software, and this growth is a sign of our success.

In 2011, RJ Ryan took over as Lead Developer to successfully continue the teams
endeavor to make Mixxx a world-class DJ software.

As our user community grows, so does our development team - Until that day, over
150 Developers, artists and translators have helped create Mixxx!

What? Why?
==========

Mixxx started as an open-source project because of demand for DJing software on
Linux, and discontent with proprietary DJ software on Windows and Mac OS
X. Today, Mixxx development is driven by the simple idea that together we can
create a better way to DJ, and that has brought Mixxx to the cutting edge. Mixxx
is the only free cross-platform vinyl control software and has the most advanced
MIDI controller support via our innovative Javascript-based MIDI scripting
engine. We are continuing to pursue new and exciting features that give DJs more
tools to create better live mixes.

System Requirements
===================

Mixxx is available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux. Mixxx is designed to use
very few system resources, but the Mixxx team suggests these minimum
requirements for having a great experience with Mixxx:

* A 2GHz or faster CPU
