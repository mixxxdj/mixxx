#question: why do dylibs embed their install name in themselves? that would seem to imply the system keeps a cache of all the "install names", but that's not what the docs seem to say.
 #todo: change the install names (-id) in a working .app to garbage and see if the app still runs.
#question: Frameworks can have included resources besides the DyLib (the basic structure is X.framework/X and X.framework/Resources).
#If you're embedding the framework, these resources might need to come along for the ride.
#but how the fuck does the framework find these files, if it needs them?
#for Qt it doesn't matter because none of their bundles have Resources
#http://developer.apple.com/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPFrameworks/Concepts/FrameworkAnatomy.html says "resources such as a shared library, nib files, image files, strings files, information property lists, documentation, header files, and so on."
 #you wouldn't need to embed Headers, but all the other things are potentially very important!
 #see: http://developer.apple.com/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPFrameworks/Tasks/CreatingFrameworks.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20002258-106880

#OKAY BOWYZ: http://developer.apple.com/documentation/CoreFoundation/Conceptual/CFBundles/Concepts/SearchAlgorithm.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001120
#so basically: Apple has a magic ObjC API that handles doing lookups in the current bundle for you (probably asks "Where was I loaded from plz?" and just uses that dir as the root dir)
#so YES, we do need to make sure to copy in the entirety of each framework's Resources/

#also good: http://lapcatsoftware.com/blog/2007/08/11/embedding-frameworks-in-loadable-bundles/
#also important: otool -D = get install name, install_name_tool -id = set install name

#so here's my algorithm:
#copy X.framework/Versions
#use `cp -R` to copy the symlinks (it's weird like that: -R is meant for Recursive but if you use it on a symlink and nothing else it makes a copy of the symlink instead of copying the file the symlink was pointing at)
 #also, the symlinks in a framework bundle are relative symlinks, so we shouldn't need to patch them
#so maybe: use `cp -R X.framework`

#QUESTIONS:
#Does Qt have an umbrella framework?
#Do Apple load lists mean that the libs are loaded at runtime for sure, or is it safe to ignore ones that aren't found (so long as the app doesn't try to actually load that library)?
#Is the working dir of an app set to it's .app dir or .app/Contents/MacOS?

#Assumption: the loadlinks inside of an embeddable framework are all relative
