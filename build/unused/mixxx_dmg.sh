#XXX this script assumes you have installed Qt with the default options (to /Developer and /Library/Frameworks). If you have not done this (e.g. have built with --no-framework which puts Qt in /usr/local/Trolltech) then stuff will need changing

#XXX
#todo: separate the 'make app' part and the 'make dmg' part.
#todo: then rewrite this in scons? if it becomes part of the rest of SConstruct then we can be smart about what libs to copy in (i.e. not copy QtScript if we don't have scripting on)

#notes to the sconsful-future:
#framework_path_template = "/Library/Frameworks/$1.framework/$1"
#dylib_path_template = "/usr/local/lib/lib$1.dylib"
#


#XXX libraries with similar names (e.g. libvorbis and libvorbisfile) can cause problems for the otool parsing magic.
