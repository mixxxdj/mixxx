==== 2.1.0 2018-04-15 ====
After two years of hard work, we are pleased to announce Mixxx 2.1. We
have overhauled the effects system, redesigned the skins, added and improved
lots of controller mappings, rewrote the audio file decoders twice, and of
course fixed a bunch of bugs. Download it!

Here is a quick summary of what is new in Mixxx 2.1.0:
  * Graphical interface scales for high resolution screens
  * Overhauled Deere and LateNight skins
  * New Tango skin
  * Effects are synchronized to the tempo
  * Effects are processed post-fader and post-crossfader and can be previewed
in headphones
  * One metaknob per effect with customizable parameter control for intuitive
use of effect chains
  * Nine new effects: Autopan, Biquad Equalizer, Biquad Full Kill Equalizer,
Loudness Contour, Metronome, Parametric Equalizer, Phaser, Stereo Balance,
Tremolo
  * Loaded effects and their parameters are saved and restored when Mixxx
restarts
  * More transparent sounding equalizers (Biquad Equalizer and Biquad Full Kill
Equalizer)
  * Improved scratching sounds with jog wheels, vinyl control, and dragging
waveforms with the mouse
  * Simplified looping and beatjump controls
  * Configurable rows of 8 samplers with up to 8 rows available for a total of
64 samplers
  * Files loaded to samplers are reloaded when Mixxx restarts
  * Improved volume normalization algorithm (EBU-R 128)
  * Filter library table by crates
  * Sort musical keys in library table by circle of fifths
  * Write metadata tags back to audio files
  * New JavaScript library for controller mapping
  * Configure multiple Internet broadcasting stations and use multiple stations
at the same time
  * Broadcast and record microphones with direct monitoring and latency
compensation
  * Broadcast and record from an external mixer
  * Booth output with independent gain knob for using sound cards with 6
output channels without an external mixer
  * Prevent screensaver from starting while Mixxx is running
  * CUP (Cue And Play) cue button mode
  * Time remaining and time elapsed now take into account the tempo fader
  * Clicking cover art now shows it full size in a separate window
  * and of course, lots and lots of bug fixes.

For users upgrading from older versions of Mixxx, we have a few important
announcements. First, if you are using Windows, you will have to uninstall any
old versions of Mixxx before you can install 2.1. How to uninstall Mixxx
varies on different versions of Windows:
  * Windows Vista, 7, and 8: Start > Control Panel > Programs > Uninstall a
Program https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2601726
  * Windows 10: Start > Control Panel > Programs > Programs And Features > look
for Mixxx > Uninstall
https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/4028054/windows-repair-or-remove-
programs-in-windows-10

If you are upgrading from an older version of Mixxx and have MP3 files in
your library, we have another important announcement. The good news is that we
fixed a bug where the waveforms and audio playback of MP3 files were
misaligned. The bad news is that we have no way of knowing which MP3 files were
affected or how much the offset was. That means that waveforms, beatgrids,
cues, and loops from older versions of Mixxx may be offset by an unknown amount
for any MP3 file. Only MP3 files were affected by this bug; other audio file
types are unaffected. You can either correct your beatgrids and cue points
manually for each track, or you can clear this information for all MP3s and
start fresh. Regardless, we recommend clearing the waveforms for all MP3
files. To clear these, type "location:mp3" into the library search bar, press
Control + A to select all tracks, right click, and select the information you
want to clear from the menu.

In the works for Mixxx 2.2, we have a big redesign of the library GUI. Along
with that will come saving & restoring search queries plus nested crates.
We are also planning on adding support for saving and loading custom effect
chain presets with the ability to import and export them to share online.

Want to help make Mixxx even more awesome? The biggest thing we need is more
people. You do not need to be a programmer to help out. Giving feedback on the
design of new features as they are being made is very valuable. Refer to the
Testing page on the wiki for more information on how to get involved with that.
Reporting bugs and telling us your ideas on the Launchpad bug tracker is a big
help too! We cannot fix problems we do not know about, so please let us know if
you find any issues with Mixxx. If you would like to help translate Mixxx into
another language, refer to the Internationalization wiki page.  Of course, more
programmers could always help. Read the Developer Documentation on the wiki for
tips on getting started contributing code to Mixxx.

We hope you have as much fun with Mixxx as we do!
