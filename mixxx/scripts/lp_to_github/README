These scripts are in raw form and need to be edited to work on anyone's machine
but my own.  But they are here so if someone else needs to move branches
from launchpad to github, it can be done.

The migrate script expects that branches are already set up.  To migrate a new
branch, do this:

1. clone the mixxx github repository
2. run git bzr import lp:foo/bar bar-update
   (use -update so that you can still have the branch named bar which will
   be the one synced with github.  That way it has the same name)
3. git checkout -b bar
4. git-filter-branch-command-all.sh
5. git branch -u origin/bar
6. git push

Now you have a git branch, bar, which is the rewritten version of the launchpad
branch.  If you run the migrate script and specify "bar-update" and "bar", it
will pull the updates from bzr into the update branch, checkout a temporary
branch, rewrite that, then checkout the "bar" branch, then merge in the new
rewritten changes.

This actually works.
