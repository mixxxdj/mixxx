## Dummy HID Device (Linux only)

If you ever need a dummy HID device to test mapping capabilities or introspect reports set by a mapping for example, you can build a dummy one using `dummy_hid_device.c`. Note that you will need `uhid` to use this daemon.

Here is how to get the daemon setup. Make sure to do this **before** Mixxx is started

```sh
# Enable UHID
sudo modprobe uhid
# This next command assumes you are running it from the Mixxx directory
#  Optionally, you can pass:
#    `-DVENDOR_ID=0x1234` to customize vendor ID
#    `-DPRODUCT_ID=0x1234` to customize product ID
#    `-DDEVICE_NAME="My Device"` to customize the device name
cd build && gcc ../tools/dummy_hid_device.c -lhidapi-hidraw -o dummy_hid_device && sudo ./dummy_hid_device
# Allow the created hidraw device to be accessed by the user. You may also set the write udev rules. Finally, you can also run Mixxx as root, but that's not recommended.
sudo chown "$USER" "$(ls -1t /dev/hidraw* | head -n 1)"
```

## Traktor S4 Mk3 Screen drawing

This small program can be used directly to draw arbitrary rectangles on the Traktor S4 Mk3 screens. It may also be useful for one to perform tests on top of the existing reversed engineered protocol.

```sh
cd build && gcc  ../tools/traktor_s4_mk3_screen_test.c `pkg-config --cflags --libs libusb-1.0` -o traktor_s4_mk3_screen_test && ./traktor_s4_mk3_screen_test
```
