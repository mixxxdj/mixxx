Firun
=====

Firun is a tool to run one or more fidlib filters on a piped stream of
raw or ASCII data.  It also allows testing impulse response, step
response and frequency response.

The tool is pretty fast, but if you are using the same filter
parameters all the time, it is probably a good idea to use Fiview to
generate custom optimised code and then write your own stdin/stdout
processing wrapper.  On one example filter, double the speed could be
achieved with special-purpose code like this.


Usage
-----

Usage: firun [options] <sampling_rate> <in_out_formats> <filter-specs> ...

Reads ASCII or raw data from STDIN, filters it, and writes ASCII or
raw data to STDOUT.  Filter spec may contain several fidlib filters in
a chain, and doesn't normally need to be quoted from the shell as all
the trailing args are joined into one string before parsing.  If more
than one filter is provided (separated by commas), then the number
should be the same as the number of input channels.  One filter will
be used on each channel, allowing different processing of left/right
channels, for example.

The <in_out_formats> specify the input and output data formats.  Raw
formats are specified with a list of [a_bwWcsSf] characters below:

  a    ASCII-encoded value (with surrounding white space/commas/semicolons)
  _    Dummy input byte (byte is skipped and ignored)
  b    Unsigned byte
  w,W  Little and big-endian unsigned 16-bit words
  c    Signed byte ('char' in C)
  s,S  Little and big-endian signed 16-bit words ('short' in C)
  f    Machine-format 32-bit floating point number

Each character except '_' indicates one input/output channel.  Each
character may be followed digits indicating a count, so "s4" is
equivalent to "ssss".  The entire list of characters and counts
defines a block of data which will be read or written as one
multi-channel sample.  Integer types are mapped to/from the range -1.0
to 1.0 on input and output (e.g. -32768 <-> -1.0, 0 <-> 0.0, 32767 <->
0.99997).  Overflows are clipped to the limit values.  

The 'a' ASCII type reads and writes text-formatted floating-point
values.  On writing, each value is terminated by either a space or a
newline, depending on whether it is the last format in the spec (so
'aaaa' gives four values per line, one line per sample).

There are also special input format specifiers to handle special cases:

  %I  Ignore STDIN and generate an impulse as input: 1 0 0 0 0 ...
  %S  Ignore STDIN and generate a step as input: 1 1 1 1 1 ...

The <in_out_formats> may either take the form <format> or
<in_format>/<out_format>.  The first form is when input and output
formats are the same, the second for different in/out formats.  The
second form must be used with %I and %S to specify the output format,
for example '%I/a'.

For details of the <filter-specs>, see the fidlib documentation and
the output of the -L option.

Options:

  -d <len>  Limit output to duration <len>.  Length may be specified as
	    [<hours>h][<minutes>m][<seconds>s][<samples>], for example:
	    '1h20m' or '250s' or '45m' or '88200' (samples).  Important 
	    for %I and %S.

  -D	    Dump filters along with brief analysis (signal delay in samples).

  -r <cnt>  Ignore STDIN and calculate the response of the filter(s)
	    and output that.  Response is calculated at <cnt>+1 points
	    from 0Hz to the Nyquist frequency.  If output format has
	    one more channel than the number of filters, then the
	    first channel is used to contain the frequency.

  -rp <cnt> As -r, except phase is also included.  The output format
	    should have 2n or 2n+1 channels, where n is the number of
	    filters.

  -L        Ignore all following arguments, output a list of 
	    available filters to STDOUT and exit.

See the fidlib.txt documentation for details of the <filter_specs>;
you can use an extended filter spec on the command line (i.e. a chain
of predefined filters and/or raw FIR/IIR coefficients).


Examples
========

firun 44100 ss BsBu10/239-247 x HsBq/0.8/-15/12000 <in.raw >out.raw

  Applies a band-stop and shelving filter to a raw 16-bit audio stream.

firun -r 10000 44100 aa BsBu10/239-247 x HsBq/0.8/-15/12000 >resp.txt

  Checks the frequency response, dumping it in ASCII

firun -d 10s 44100 %I/a BsBu10/239-247 x HsBq/0.8/-15/12000 >impulse.txt

  Tests the impulse response (the first 10 seconds)

firun 44100 ss BsBu10/239-247 x HsBq/0.8/-15/12000, HsBq/0.8/-15/12000 <in.raw >out.raw

  to both channels.
