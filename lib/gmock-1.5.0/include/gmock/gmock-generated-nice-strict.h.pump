// Implements class templates NiceMock and StrictMock.
//
// Given a mock class MockFoo that is created using Google Mock,
// NiceMock<MockFoo> is a subclass of MockFoo that allows
// uninteresting calls (i.e. calls to mock methods that have no
// EXPECT_CALL specs), and StrictMock<MockFoo> is a subclass of
// MockFoo that treats all uninteresting calls as errors.
//
// NiceMock and StrictMock "inherits" the constructors of their
// respective base class, with up-to $n arguments.  Therefore you can
// write NiceMock<MockFoo>(5, "a") to construct a nice mock where
// MockFoo has a constructor that accepts (int, const char*), for
// example.
//
// A known limitation is that NiceMock<MockFoo> and
// StrictMock<MockFoo> only works for mock methods defined using the
// MOCK_METHOD* family of macros DIRECTLY in the MockFoo class.  If a
// mock method is defined in a base class of MockFoo, the "nice" or
// "strict" modifier may not affect it, depending on the compiler.  In
// particular, nesting NiceMock and StrictMock is NOT supported.
//
// Another known limitation is that the constructors of the base mock
// cannot have arguments passed by non-const reference, which are
// banned by the Google C++ style guide anyway.
