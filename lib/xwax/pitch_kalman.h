/*
 * Kalman filter pitch estimator with sensitivity mode switches
 *
 * Model: Constant velocity (x, v) with acceleration process noise
 *
 * State:
 *   x : Position (s) relative to the predicted trajectory
 *   v : Velocity (dimensionless) relative to the carrier frequency of the timecode (normalized)
 *
 * Assumption: We steadily advance with a constant velocity
 *
 *   dx: The displacement of the position by which we advanced (s).
 *       When crossing a zero this is 1/4 of cycle of the sinusoid
 *       (Ï€/2) quantized to the resolution of the timecode.
 *
 *       When not crossing a zero, a displacement of 0.0 is passed,
 *       which signifies no movement and lets the velocity decay slowly
 *       until the next zero crossing is encountered.
 *
 * Observation:
 *   z = dx (new measurement after the interval dt)
 *
 * Modes:
 *   stable  : Low Q and high R for stable playback
 *   adjust  : Medium values for slight pitch changes
 *   reactive: High Q and low R for high reactivity (scratching)
