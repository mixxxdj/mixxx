This is a name resolving library that's threadsafe.

Right now it only implements this with mutexes, but we should extend it to use gethostbyXXXX_r()
if it's available.

It shoudl work on win32, but i'm probably forgetting a headerfile.

API is basically not going to change.  Please consult with the rest of the team before changing the interface.
