# Test Plan

Below are a set of user interactions that are expected to work consistently across all
Link-enabled apps. In order to provide the best user experience, it's important that apps
behave consistently with respect to these test cases. ## Tempo Changes

### TEMPO-1: Tempo changes should be transmitted between connected apps.

- Open LinkHut, press **Play** and **enable** Link.
- Open App and **enable** Link.
- Without starting to play, change tempo in App **&rArr;** LinkHut clicks should speed up or slow down to match the tempo specified in
the App.
- Start playing in the App **&rArr;** App and LinkHut should be in sync
- Change tempo in App and in LinkHut **&rArr;** App and LinkHut should remain in sync

### TEMPO-2: Opening an app with Link enabled should not change the tempo of an existing Link session.

- Open App and **enable** Link.
- Set App tempo to 100bpm.
- Terminate App.
- Open LinkHut, press **Play** and **enable** Link.
- Set LinkHut tempo to 130bpm.
- Open App and **enable** Link. **&rArr;** Link should be connected (“1 Link”) and the App and
LinkHut’s tempo should both be 130bpm.

### TEMPO-3: When connected, loading a new document should not change the Link session tempo.

- Open LinkHut, press **Play** and **enable** Link.
- Set LinkHut tempo to 130bpm.
- Open App and **enable** Link **&rArr;** LinkHut’s tempo should not change.
- Load new Song/Set/Session with a tempo other than 130bpm **&rArr;** App and LinkHut tempo should both be 130bpm.

### TEMPO-4: Tempo range handling.

- Open LinkHut, press **Play**, enable Link.
- Open App, start Audio, and **enable** Link.
- Change tempo in LinkHut to **20bpm** **&rArr;** App and LinkHut should stay in sync.
- Change Tempo in LinkHut to **999bpm** **&rArr;** App and LinkHut should stay in sync.
- If App does not support the full range of tempos supported by Link, it should stay in sync by switching to a multiple of the Link session tempo.

### TEMPO-5: Enabling Link does not change app's tempo if there is no Link session to join.
- Open App, start playing.
- Change App tempo to something other than the default.
- **Enable** Link **&rArr;** App's tempo should not change.
- Change App tempo to a new value (not the default).
- **Disable** Link **&rArr;** App's tempo should not change.

## Beat Time

These cases verify the continuity of beat time across Link operations.

### BEATTIME-1: Enabling Link does not change app's beat time if there is no Link session to join.
- Open App, start playing.
- **Enable** Link **&rArr;** No beat time jump or audible discontinuity should occur.
- **Disable** Link **&rArr;** No beat time jump or audible discontinuity should occur.

### BEATTIME-2: App's beat time does not change if another participant joins its session.
- Open App and **enable** Link.
- Start playing.
- Open LinkHut and **enable** Link **&rArr;** No beat time jump or audible discontinuity should occur in the App.

**Note**: When joining an existing Link session, an app should adjust to the existing
session's tempo and phase, which will usually result in a beat time jump. Apps that are
already in a session should never have any kind of beat time or audio discontinuity when
a new participant joins the session.

## Start Stop States

### STARTSTOPSTATE-1: Listening to start/stop commands from other peers.
- Open App, set Link and Start Stop Sync to **Enabled**.
- Open LinkHut, **enable** Link and Start Stop Sync and press **Play** **&rArr;** App should start playing according to its quantization.
- Stop playback in LinkHut **&rArr;** App should stop playing.

### STARTSTOPSTATE-2: Sending start/stop commands to other peers.
- Open LinkHut, **enable** Link and Start Stop Sync and press **Play**.
- Open App, set Link and Start Stop Sync to **Enabled** **&rArr;** App should not be
playing while LinkHut continues playing.
- Start playback in App **&rArr;** App should join playing according to its quantization.
- Stop playback in App **&rArr;** App and LinkHut should stop playing.
- Start playback in App **&rArr;** App and LinkHut should start playing according to
their quantizations.

## Audio Engine

These cases verify the correct implementation of latency compensation within an app's
audio engine.

### AUDIOENGINE-1: Correct alignment of app audio with shared session

- Connect the audio out of your computer to the audio in. Alternatively use
[SoundFlower](https://github.com/mattingalls/Soundflower) to be able to record the output
of your app and LinkHut.
- Open LinkHut, **enable** Link and press **Play**.
- Open App and **enable** Link.
- Start playing audio (preferably a short, click-like sample) with notes on the same beats as LinkHut.
- Record audio within application of choice.
- Validate whether onset of the sample aligns with the pulse generated by LinkHut (tolerance: less than 3 ms).
