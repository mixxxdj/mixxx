# Mixxx Contributor Agreement (CLA)

Thank you for contributing to the Mixxx project!

In order to distribute your changes with Mixxx, we need a record of your
permission to distribute them under Mixxx's license.

Mixxx is distributed under the GNU General Public License Version 2 (the
GPLv2). The full text of the GPLv2 can be found at [1]. Because a significant
number of Mixxx downloads are through the Mac OS X App Store, we also license
Mixxx under the GPLv2 with a special "App Store Exception". For more details on
GPL exceptions, see [2].

The text of the Mixxx App Store Exception is as follows:

13. In addition, as a special exception, you are granted the additional
right to distribute this Program subject to the Mac App Store Product
Usage Rules and Licensed Application End User License Agreement,
if the source code is made available on the Mixxx Website under the
terms of the GPL.

By submitting this form, you agree to the following terms for your present and
future contributions to Mixxx:

* You retain the copyright on your contribution but give Mixxx irrevocable
  permission to distribute your contribution under the above license. We will
  contact you to obtain your permission to change the license terms of your
  contributions. You agree that if we cannot reach you within 30 days by the
  email address you provide below then you permit Mixxx to re-license your
  contributions without your explicit permission. 

* You represent that you are legally entitled to grant the above license. If
  your employer has the rights to your contributions, you represent that you
  have permission from your employer to grant the above license.
