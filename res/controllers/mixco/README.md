Mixco Scripts
=============

Some of the scripts in the parent folder are the compile output of
**Mixco**, a tool that can generate the `.xml` and `.js` files from a
single source file, among other things.  This folder contains the
original sources for such scripts.

If you modify these scripts, you need to use the `mixco` command to
compile the `.xml` and `.js` files that Mixxx can read.  To install
it, you need [NPM](https://www.npmjs.org/) and then:
```sh
    $ npm install -g mixco
```

You can find more information on how to install and use this
tool [in the offical Mixco website](https://sinusoid.es/mixco/).
