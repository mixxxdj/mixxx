## Building Mixxx

First, open a terminal (on Windows, use "x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for

source code and navigate to it:

    $ git clone https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx.git
    $ cd mixxx

Fetch the required dependencies and set up the build environment by running the
corresponding command for your operating system:

| macOS | `source tools/macos_buildenv.sh setup` |
| Debian/Ubuntu | `tools/debian_buildenv.sh setup` |
| Fedora | `tools/rpm_buildenv.sh setup` |
| Other Linux distros | See the [wiki article](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/wiki/Compiling%20on%20Linux) |

To build Mixxx, run

    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
