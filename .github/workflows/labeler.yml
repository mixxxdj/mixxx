      # Using an app is the recommended way to allow recursive operations.
      # Apps offer a way to have reduced scoped permissions (like GITHUB_TOKEN)
      # and short lifespan, unlike PAT.
      # As we are trialing this approach tho, it is fine to play with a PAT and not spend the
      # extra time setting up an app
